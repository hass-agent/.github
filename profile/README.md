# HASS.Agent Organization 🚀

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the forked version of HASS.Agent!

## About HASS.Agent

HASS.Agent is a powerful tool for integrating Home Assistant with Windows environments, providing seamless automation capabilities.

## About fork

The original HASS.Agent has been created by [Sam](https://github.com/LAB02-Admin).

Unfortunately due to some time constraints, they're not able to provide the constant support and feature updates. After some initial comms, we haven't been able to get in touch with them.
That's where we step in - trying to keep HASS.Agent bug free (dreams need to be big right?) and to introduce new features here and there!

### How about a different name not to confuse people over original and fork?

Yeah, very good question. We've started as an idea to keep HASS.Agent alive until Sam comes back (that's why all donations still link to Sam, we don't need them). Now it seems it won't happen anytime soon. Knowing this I'd have changed the fork's name right away to be more transparent and introduce less confusion.
On that note, we're working on a full rewrite what definitely will have its own name :)
